#Tasks for Part 1
- Create a function that will find the tag with ID of #headline, and will change that box's innerHTML to "Welcome to Upperline!"
- Create a function that will find all the tags with class of .feature, and will change the first one's font-family to "Comic Sans MS"
- Create a function that will find the img tag with the ID of #bestimage, and will change the src attribute to the chocolate chip cookie
- Then, use the three buttons' onclick attributes to activate those three functions!
- Challenge: Create a function that will find all paragraph tags, and will change all of the paragraph tags


#Tasks for Part 2
- Create a function that runs every time your cookie is clicked. 
- Create a variable that counts how many times the cookie is clicked, and then display that in the numclicks tag.

- - Change the background color
- - Change the cookie's appearance
